## Installing the cli
You can either:
1. Create a symlink to the index.js file so you can always have the latest version installed as you make changes to the file using
```npm link```

Or
2. install once globally using ```cd daft-cove-cli && npm install -g``` , If the files changed you'll need to install it globally again
